      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>Express.</strong> is a key topic in <strong>TypeScript with Other Frameworks</strong>. Apply the same type discipline across popular application frameworks. This section explains what it is, why it exists, how TypeScript treats it, and how it connects to surrounding language features.
