      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>@types packages.</strong> is a key topic in <strong>Declaration Files & Type Definitions</strong>. Describe JavaScript libraries and share types across package boundaries. This section explains what it is, why it exists, how TypeScript treats it, and how it connects to surrounding language features.
