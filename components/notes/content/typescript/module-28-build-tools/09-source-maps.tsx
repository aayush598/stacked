      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>Source maps.</strong> is a key topic in <strong>Build Tools & Bundlers</strong>. Integrate TypeScript with the bundlers and runtimes teams actually use. This section explains what it is, why it exists, how TypeScript treats it, and how it connects to surrounding language features.
