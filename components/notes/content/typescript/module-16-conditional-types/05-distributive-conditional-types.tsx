      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>Distributive conditional types.</strong> is a key topic in <strong>Conditional Types</strong>. Choose types based on assignability and distribute them across unions. This section explains what it is, why it exists, how TypeScript treats it, and how it connects to surrounding language features.
