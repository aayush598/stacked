      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>Isolated modules.</strong> is a key topic in <strong>Performance & Optimization</strong>. Keep type checking fast as the codebase grows. This section explains what it is, why it exists, how TypeScript treats it, and how it connects to surrounding language features.
