      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>Team adoption.</strong> is a key topic in <strong>Migrating JavaScript to TypeScript</strong>. Move a real codebase without stopping product work. This section explains what it is, why it exists, how TypeScript treats it, and how it connects to surrounding language features.
