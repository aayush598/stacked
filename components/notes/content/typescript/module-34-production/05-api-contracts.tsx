      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>API contracts.</strong> is a key topic in <strong>TypeScript in Production</strong>. Ship typed applications with observability, validation, and strong CI. This section explains what it is, why it exists, how TypeScript treats it, and how it connects to surrounding language features.
