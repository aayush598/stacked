      <NoteHeading>Concept & mental model</NoteHeading>
      <NoteText>
        <strong>{"Uncontrolled forms."}</strong> is an essential topic in <strong>{"React forms and actions"}</strong>. Understand the problem it solves, how it behaves during render/update cycles, and how it composes with props, state, effects, context, refs, and other React primitives.
